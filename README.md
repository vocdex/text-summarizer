<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
It's a simple web app that I created from scratch to practice my Flask and NLP skills. The app receives a text input and returns 
maximum length of 64 character summary.  
I made use of HuggingFace pipeline by downloading the checkpoint, DistillBart which is a distilled version of BART.
BART is a sequence-to-sequence model trained as a denoising autoencoder.  
Distilled BART is a distilled version of BART that keeps up 97% of BART performance while reducing the model size by 40%.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/vocdex/text-summarizer.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```
## Issues
Even though a lighter distilled version of the model is used, it is still large(~423MB)and takes a while to download and cache the model when the user runs the app for the first time.
